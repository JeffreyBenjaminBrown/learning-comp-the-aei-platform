** a database of what? apps? baseball stats?
in the README.md and DATABASE.md documents for comp
https://github.com/comp-org/comp
** does spelling matter?
In Matchups/matchups/defaults.json, under the "pitcher" field there appears this note:
"Make sure the name of the pitcher is correct. A good place to reference this is baseball-reference.com",
That is followed by a validator that lists peoples' names. Does the validator obsolete the note?
** Are duplicates meaningful in a validator?
The pitcher validator includes duplicates, e.g. three people named Bob Adams. Does each of those duplicate strings somehow represent a separate person?
** should I send python code to execute the docker container
